## Background and Context

Here are the features of Catstagram:

- It shows a random kitten picture from the `https://thecatapi.com/` API.
- Users can vote on the picture.
- Users can comment on the picture.
- Users can delete comments.
- Users can request a new random kitten image to be shown.

The most important feature of Catstagram is that all of the other features
listed above can be performed without requiring a page reload. For example,
when a new comment is created, the comment smoothly gets added to the page
without requiring the website to reload.

In building Catstagram, the fundamentals of interacting with
APIs and implementing DOM manipulation behaviors in response to API calls are shown.


## Phases

1. Fetch a new cat image on page load and display it
2. Add interactivity to the page with buttons and forms
3. Store the application state on the client
